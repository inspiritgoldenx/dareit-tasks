# task 6
## the aim was to learn *what Infrastructure as a Code is*, *to write scripts that automate resource creation in GCP* and how to *create resources in GCP with a few commands* ðŸ¤“ðŸ“š
1. first of all I opened the Cloud Shell and checked the version of Terraform using the command:
```
terraform version
```
2. in the next step I have created a *main.tf*, where I pasted the code:
```
provider "google" {

  project = "mindful-hall-377614"

  region  = "us-central1"

  zone    = "us-central1-c"

}





resource "google_compute_instance" "dare-id-vm" {

  name         = "dareit-vm-tf"

  machine_type = "e2-medium"

  zone         = "us-central1-a"



  tags = ["dareit"]



  boot_disk {

    initialize_params {

      image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"

      labels = {

        managed_by_terraform = "true"

      }

    }

  }



  network_interface {

    network = "default"



    access_config {

      // Ephemeral public IP

    }

  }

}
```
3. where in above code the line with *project name* is individual and depends on our project name in Google Cloud ðŸ˜„
4. after that, I wrote the below code in my terminal in Cloud Shell:
```
terraform init
```
5. next one was: 
```
terraform plan
```

to check the plan of the terraform
6. after that, it asked me to *authorize Cloud Shell to perform actions using your credentials* (thankâ€™s to this terraform will now rely on your credentials in your project in order to be able to create resources)
7. next, I have used the command:
```
terraform apply
```
where terraform once again showed me the plan (as in previous step with the command *terraform plan*, I confirmed it by **yes** becasue I wanted it to apply)

8. and ðŸŽ‰ it worked
9. in the next step I went to *Compute Engine* --> **VM Instances** in the navigation panel in Google Cloud 
10. after going inside the folder, there was a resource which is using terraform ðŸŽ‰ 
11. later I used the command:
```
cat terraform.tfstate
```
to view the content of the file

12. later, I have manually changed *network tag*, **save**
13. and went back to Cloud Shell to run *terraform plan* again
14. thanks to that, I saw that Terraform detected the definition of the resource from the main.tf = they are now different
15. next I have run the Terraform again by: *terraform apply*, *confirm* and what I see? the network tag is there again
16. after this exercise, I delted the *dare-it-vm-tf VM Instance*  
17. last but not least, as part of this task, [I have created resource using terraform](https://github.com/inspiritgoldenx/dareit-tasks/blob/main/task_6/main.txt)
