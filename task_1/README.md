# task 1
## the main purpose was to find **a command to list enabled services**
1. for this task, I used Cloud Shell (but it can be also Cloud SDK)
2. I've checked for the command in the [gcloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference)
3. after finding the command:
```
gcloud services list --enabled
```
4. I pasted it into the first task folder named task_1 in the file: [enabled_services](https://github.com/inspiritgoldenx/dareit-tasks/blob/main/task_1/enabled_services)
