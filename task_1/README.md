# task 1
## the main purpose was to find a *command to list enabled services*
1. for this task, I used Cloud Shell (but it can be also Cloud SDK)
2. I've searched for the command in the [gcloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference)
3. after finding the command in [gcloud services list](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/list):
```
gcloud services list --enabled
```
4. I pasted it into Cloud Shell 
5. after pressing enter, Cloud Shell created a list of services that are enabled or available to be enabled by a project
6. I copied the the whole list and have inserted it into my folder named task_1 in the file: [enabled_services](https://github.com/inspiritgoldenx/dareit-tasks/blob/main/task_1/enabled_services)
7. task done :tada:
