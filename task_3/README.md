# task 3
## the aim was to learn *how to run a python script* and *create a cloud function*
1.  first, I opened the terminal in Cloud Shell and wrote:
```
vim hello.py
```
after that, I pressed: **ESC** then **SHIFT+I**, thanks to that, it will allow VIM to enter the INSERT mode. In the INSERT mode, I am able to edit the file (which is empty for now)
