# task 3
## the aim was to learn *how to run a python script* and *create a cloud function*
1.  first, I opened the terminal in Cloud Shell and wrote:
```
vim hello.py
```
2. after that, I pressed: **ESC** then **SHIFT+I**, thanks to that, it will allow VIM to enter the *INSERT* mode. In the INSERT mode, I am able to edit the file (which is empty for now)
3. in the *INSERT* mode I typed:
```
print('Hello DareIT')
```
4. pressed **ESC**, then typed **:wq** end pressed **Enter** to go out
5. mini info: ![dareITminiinfopic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125319277/231571490-13b3a440-5b5c-4740-a52a-691cb69cb15e.jpg)
6. that, what I've done was creating the first python script, the script is stored in our [hello.py](<http://hello.py>) file. In order to run it, I can type in the terminal:
 ```
 python hello.py
 ```
 7. after this, **Hello DareIT** is printed in the terminal :smiley:
