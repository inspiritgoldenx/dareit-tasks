# task 2
## the main goal was *to host a static website in a GCS bucket.*
1.  I opened the (console.cloud.google.com) and choosed on the *Navigation Menu* --> *Cloud Storage* --> *Bucket* and clicked on **create bucket**
2.  I created a bucket named: **example-bucket-070**. It is important that the bucket name has to be unique across ALL projects that exist in GCP. For example, when we create a bucket named: ml-unique-bucket-name we will got an error.
3. While creating the bucket according to the instruction, I choosed:
a) *location type* --> **multi-region: eu (multiple regions in European Union)**
b) *ggg*
