# task 5
## the main goal of the task was to learn how to create Cloud SQL instance
1. first of all I opened **Cloud SQL** from the *Navigation Menu* in Google Cloud and clicked ***CREATE INSTANCE***
2. after that, I chose the **Choose PostgreSQL** (second option) and filled the information there

Instance ID = dareit-pg (please note the the instance-id needs to be unique within the GCP project)
Password - whatever password you want to the admin user. If you forget it, donâ€™t worry, you can change it later from GCP console.
database version - that is the version of the engine - choose PostgreSQL 14
configuration to start - Sandbox - we are just playing around
