# task 5
## the main goal of the task was to learn how to create Cloud SQL instance ðŸ˜º
1. first of all I opened **Cloud SQL** from the *Navigation Menu* in Google Cloud and clicked ***CREATE INSTANCE***
2. after that, I chose the **PostgreSQL** (second option) and filled the information there
3. I have added: Instance ID = *dareit-pg* (because the instance-id needs to be unique within the GCP project), Password = *whatever* (I made some up), Database version = here I chose *PostgreSQL 14* because that is the version of the engine, configuration to start = I chose *Sandbox* (because it's for me to train)
4. next step was to customize the instance, so I went to *Connections* where I chose **Public IP** , then I chose **ADD NETWORK** (under the Authorised Networks section) - thanks to that, I will be able to add an IP from which packets will be allowed to the Database Instance
5. so after that, I have googled my IP number and pasted it into *Newtork* field, then **save** and the instance was created

6. the second step in the task was to use a program named *Dbeaver* to connect to the database 
7. after opening Open Dbeaver, on the left hand side in the white space - I clicked with the right click and chose to *Create New Folder*, I named it **DareIT**
8. then by clicking the folder and chose **Create Connection** --> and chose **PostgreSQL** 
9. after opening it, I had to fill the new opened window with some data: host = here I entered *my IP address*, Database = *postgres*, Port = *5432* (I think it was already set by default), Username = *postgres* (also set by deafult), Password - here I typed the same passwort, which I had provided for the admin user while creating the instance.
10. after everything was added, tried to test the connection and ðŸŽ‰ it worked!
11. next step in the task was to create a schema in the database, so I clicked on the **Schemas** --> **create new schema** and typed the name of the schema
12. afterwards, I clicked with the right click on the new generated folder which appeard in *Schemas* --> *dareit* and chose **new sql script**
13. a new editor showed up, where I pasted this SQL code:
  ```
  CREATE TABLE students (

    id int,

    lastName varchar(255),

    firstName varchar(255),

    email varchar(255),

    city varchar(255)

);
```
14. to execute it, I clicked the orange arrow on the left and thanks to that, I received newly created Table in the Navigator
15. after this I chose Generate SQL by clicking with the right click and saw few commands which I can use, for example *INSERT* --> it generated for me a code, which I can later edit, the code looked:
```
INSERT INTO dareit.students

(id, lastname, firstname, email, city)

VALUES(0, '', '', '', '');
```
16. after generating the code, I filled it up with some data (as above: id, lastname etc.)
17. later I selected data from the students table by writing 
 ```
 select * from dareit.students
```
18. thanks to the commands like *INSERT*, *UPDATE*, *DELETE* and others, it is possible to edit the table
19. one of the tasks was to create few more columns with *age* and few more rows --> [the table](https://github.com/inspiritgoldenx/dareit-tasks/blob/main/task_5/table.md)
20. afterwards I created (searched) for a query which answered the question ***what is average age of the students in the class?***
21. the query: 
```
SELECT AVG(ages) as avg_ages
FROM students;
```
the answer ***26,5***
